# Data Size Impact Benchmarks

This document analyzes how Volt's performance scales with different data sizes, from small to large payloads.

## Test Configuration

- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro
- **Build**: Release mode
- **Runtime**: Tokio async runtime
- **Storage**: DashMap concurrent hash map
- **Data Sizes**: 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 bytes
- **Data Pattern**: Sequential bytes (0-255 cycling)

## Operations Tested

### 1. SET Operations with Variable Sizes
Writing keys with increasing payload sizes.

```rust
let data = generate_data(size);
cluster.set(format!("key_{}", size), data.clone(), None).await
```

Results:
- 10 bytes: 777.53ns [770.17-784.76ns]
- 100 bytes: 888.58ns [883.15-894.05ns]
- 1,000 bytes: 1.03µs [1.024-1.039µs]
- 10,000 bytes: 1.09µs [1.091-1.099µs]
- 100,000 bytes: 11.05µs [10.532-11.689µs]

Analysis:
- Sub-microsecond latency up to 1KB
- Linear scaling up to 10KB (1.14x-1.16x per 10x size)
- Notable jump at 100KB (10.09x increase)
- Significant variance increase at 100KB (10.47% range)
- Memory allocation impact visible at larger sizes

### 2. GET Operations with Variable Sizes
Reading keys with different payload sizes.

```rust
cluster.get(&format!("key_{}", size))
```

Results:
- 10 bytes: 108.63ns [107.99-109.31ns]
- 100 bytes: 105.71ns [105.16-106.30ns]
- 1,000 bytes: 137.94ns [137.52-138.36ns]
- 10,000 bytes: 230.58ns [228.45-232.66ns]
- 100,000 bytes: 979.29ns [977.28-981.48ns]

Analysis:
- Sub-microsecond performance throughout all sizes
- Performance pattern by range:
  * Optimal at small sizes (2.7% improvement from 10B to 100B)
  * 30.5% increase at 1KB (137.94ns)
  * 67.2% increase at 10KB (230.58ns)
  * 4.25x increase at 100KB (979.29ns)
- Remarkably stable performance (0.43% variance at 100KB)

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Analysis

1. **Base Latency** (10 bytes):
   - SET: 777.53ns [770.17-784.76ns]
   - GET: 108.63ns [107.99-109.31ns]
   - GET/SET Ratio: ~7.2x faster reads

2. **Scaling Patterns by Size Range**:
   - Small (10B - 100B):
     * SET: 14.3% increase (777.53ns to 888.58ns)
     * GET: 2.7% improvement (108.63ns to 105.71ns)

     * GET: 4.25x increase (230.58ns to 979.29ns)

### Size Impact Patterns

1. **Small Payloads** (≤100 bytes):
   - Minimal overhead
   - GET operations show optimal performance
   - Ideal for key-value metadata
   - Extremely stable performance (1-2% variance)

2. **Medium Payloads** (1KB - 10KB):
   - Linear scaling for SET operations
   - Sub-linear scaling for GET operations
   - Good for typical document storage
   - Moderate variance (2-3% range)

3. **Large Payloads** (>10KB):
   - Significant performance impact
   - Memory operations become dominant
   - Consider chunking data
   - High variance in SET operations (10.47%)
   - Stable GET operations (0.43% variance)

## Memory and Performance Trade-offs

### Memory Management
1. **Small Objects**:
   - Efficient memory utilization
   - Low fragmentation
   - Fast allocation

2. **Large Objects**:
   - Higher allocation cost
   - Potential fragmentation
   - Memory pressure on GC

### Performance Optimization Points
1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Pre-allocation for known sizes
   - Buffer pooling for common sizes
   - Chunking for large payloads

2. **Copy Operations**:
   - Zero-copy for small payloads
   - Streaming for large data
   - Buffer reuse strategies

## Observations and Recommendations

### Strong Points
1. Excellent small payload performance (<1KB)
2. Predictable scaling up to 10KB
3. Sub-microsecond performance throughout all sizes
4. Exceptional GET operation stability

### Areas for Improvement
1. Large payload handling (>10KB)
2. Memory allocation strategy (10.47% variance at 100KB)
3. Buffer management for big data
4. SET operation stability at large sizes

### Usage Recommendations
1. Optimal for payloads under 1KB
2. Acceptable performance up to 10KB
3. Consider chunking data above 10KB

## Future Work

1. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Zero-copy operations
   - Smart buffer pooling
   - Streaming large values

2. **Additional Tests Needed**:
   - Random payload sizes
   - Compressed data handling
   - Memory fragmentation impact
   - Long-term memory behavior

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Automatic payload chunking
   - Compression for large values
   - Smart allocation strategies

### Statistical Analysis

1. **Measurement Stability**:
   - SET operations: 2-8% outliers across sizes
   - GET operations: 1-6% outliers across sizes
   - Higher variance in larger payload tests

2. **Confidence Intervals**:
   - Small payloads (≤100B): Very tight (~1-2% range)
   - Medium payloads (1KB-10KB): Moderate (~2-3% range)
   - Large payloads (100KB): Wider range (~10% for SET)

3. **Outlier Patterns**:
   - More outliers in SET operations
   - Increased outliers with payload size
   - Mix of high and low outliers suggests system noise

### Notes on Methodology
- All benchmarks run on the same machine in sequence
- System was idle during measurements
- Each operation includes full end-to-end timing
- Criterion automatically warms up the system before measuring
- Results exclude initialization time (cluster setup)
