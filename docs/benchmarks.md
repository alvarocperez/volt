# Volt Benchmarks

This document provides an overview of the performance benchmarks for the Volt key-value store.

## Overview

Volt is designed for ultra-low latency operations, with a focus on in-memory performance. The benchmarks measure various aspects of the system's performance characteristics.

## Core Benchmarks

The following core operations have been benchmarked:

1. **GET Operation**: ~80ns [75-85ns]
   - Synchronous operation
   - Direct memory access via DashMap
   - No async overhead

2. **SET Operation**: ~4µs [3.8-4.2µs]
   - Asynchronous operation
   - Includes hashing, node lookup, and replication

3. **DELETE Operation**: ~3.7µs [3.5-3.9µs]
   - Asynchronous operation
   - Similar overhead to SET but slightly faster

4. **Cluster Setup**: ~40µs
   - Time to initialize a cluster with 100 virtual nodes
   - Includes setting up the consistent hashing ring

## Specialized Benchmarks

For more detailed performance analysis, we have separate benchmark documents:

1. [**Data Size Impact**](data_size_benchmarks.md)
   - How value size affects operation latency
   - Scaling patterns from 10B to 100KB

2. [**Concurrent Operations**](concurrent_benchmarks.md)
   - Performance under different concurrency levels
   - Scaling from 1 to 1000 concurrent operations

3. [**Bulk Operations**](bulk_operations_benchmarks.md)
   - Performance of sequential operations
   - Batch processing characteristics

4. [**JSON Operations**](json_benchmarks.md)
   - Performance of JSON document storage and retrieval
   - Impact of document complexity and size
   - Serialization/deserialization overhead

## Performance Summary

| Operation | Average Latency | Range | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-------|
| GET | 80ns | 75-85ns | Best case, no TTL check |
| SET | 4µs | 3.8-4.2µs | With replication factor 2 |
| DELETE | 3.7µs | 3.5-3.9µs | With replication factor 2 |
| JSON GET (simple) | 1µs | 0.9-1.8µs | Varies with document size |
| JSON GET (complex) | 5-500µs | 1.2µs-0.5ms | Scales with complexity |
| JSON SET (simple) | 4-7µs | 4.2-6.8µs | Minimal overhead over binary |
| JSON SET (complex) | 5-1200µs | 5.1µs-1.2ms | Dominated by serialization |

## Scaling Characteristics

- **GET operations** scale almost linearly with data size up to ~10KB
- **SET operations** show more overhead with larger values
- **Concurrent operations** scale well up to ~100 operations, then show increased variance
- **JSON operations** performance is dominated by serialization/deserialization for complex documents

## Test Environment

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-9700K @ 3.6GHz
- **Memory**: 32GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Rust**: 1.70.0
- **Build**: Release mode with optimizations

## Methodology

All benchmarks were conducted using Criterion.rs, a statistics-driven benchmarking library for Rust. Each benchmark was run with the following parameters:

- Minimum of 100 measurements per operation
- Warm-up iterations to eliminate cold-start effects
- Statistical analysis to identify outliers
- Confidence intervals calculated for all measurements

## Future Benchmark Plans

1. **Network Latency**: Measure performance across network boundaries
2. **Persistence Impact**: Evaluate the overhead of persistence options
3. **Large Cluster Scaling**: Test with 10+ nodes and various replication factors
4. **Real-world Workloads**: Benchmark with YCSB-like workload patterns

## Current Configuration

Benchmarks are run using:
- Criterion.rs for precise measurements
- Release build mode
- Tokio runtime for async operations
- DashMap for concurrent storage
- 100 measurements per operation
- Confidence intervals reported as [min, median, max]

## Core Operations

### 1. Cluster Setup
```rust
group.bench_function("setup", |b| {
    b.iter(|| {
        let mut cluster = KVCluster::new(100, 2);
        rt.block_on(async {
            cluster.add_node("node1".to_string());
            cluster.add_node("node2".to_string());
        });
        cluster
    })
});
```
- **Description**: Initialization of a cluster with two nodes
- **Configuration**: 100 virtual nodes, replication factor 2
- **Result**: ~40µs [39.2-40.1µs]
- **Measured Components**:
  - Data structures creation
  - Consistent hash ring initialization
  - Node and async channel setup

        rt.block_on(async {
            cluster.set("key".to_string(), b"value".to_vec(), None).await
        })
    })
});
